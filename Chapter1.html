        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <p> Once upon a time, there was a girl called Cinderella, who often felt sad. She had two silly stepsisters, and a stepmother who was not very nice to her. Cinderella worked hard, but the sisters were never satisfied. Every night Cinderella sat by the fireside with the mice.</p> 
        <p>One day the two stepsisters were being beastly to Cinderella, when a letter arrived.It was an invitation to a ball at the palace, but Cinderella’s stepmother banned her from going.Instead, Cinderella had to help both her bossy sisters get ready for the ball. “We look fabulous,” they boasted, “I love my beautiful bows”, “I love my perfect pearls”.</p>
        <p>As the carriage disappeared, Cinderella felt tears come to her eyes.
        The palace was so near but Cinderella feared she would never see inside it.
        Suddenly, an old woman with glittery wings and a wand appeared! “I’m your fairy godmother!” she said with a wave of her wand. “You will have your wish and go to the ball”.</p>
        <p>“First, we will need to find some things,” she said, with a wink. “Bring me a pumpkin please,” said Cinderella’s fairy godmother. With a twitch of a wing and a swing of her wand, she flung fairy magic high into the air.</p>
