        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <p> Once upon a time, there was a girl called Cinderella, who often felt sad. She had two silly stepsisters, and a stepmother who was not very nice to her. </p>
        <p>Cinderella worked hard, but the sisters were never satisfied. Every night Cinderella sat by the fireside with the mice.</p> 
        <p>One day the two stepsisters were being beastly to Cinderella, when a letter arrived.</p>
        <p>It was an invitation to a ball at the palace, but Cinderella’s stepmother banned her from going.</p>
        <p>Instead, Cinderella had to help both her bossy sisters get ready for the ball. </p>
        <p>“We look fabulous,” they boasted, “I love my beautiful bows”, “I love my perfect pearls”.</p>

        <p>As the carriage disappeared, Cinderella felt tears come to her eyes.</p>
        <p>The palace was so near but Cinderella feared she would never see inside it.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, an old woman with glittery wings and a wand appeared!</p>
        <p>“I’m your fairy godmother!” she said with a wave of her wand. “You will have your wish and go to the ball”.</p>
        <p>“First, we will need to find some things,” she said, with a wink.</p>
        <p>“Bring me a pumpkin please,” said Cinderella’s fairy godmother.</p>
        <p>With a twitch of a wing and a swing of her wand, she flung fairy magic high into the air!</p>
