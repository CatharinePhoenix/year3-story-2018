        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <p>Cinderella gave a frightened cry – she hadn’t noticed the time! She gave a quick apology to the prince and ran off. As she ran down the flight of steps she left behind on of her glass slippers. </p>
        <p>Cinderella jumped into the carriage, but the magic wore off just as she started the journey home. The carriage turned back into a giant pumpkin, the horses became mice again and her gown and jewels vanished.</p>
        <p>The handsome prince’s heart was very heavy. He had fallen in love with Cinderella, and wanted to visit every house in his country with her glass slipper. “I will hunt high and low,” said the prince. “Whoever this slipper fits shall be my bride.” He hunted all night and all day, just as he said and visited all the homes in his kingdom. Soon he arrived at the house where Cinderella lived with her stepmother and stepsisters. </p> 
        <p>The prince called everyone in to try on the slipper, Of course, the stepsisters feet couldn’t fit. Cinderella stood quietly in the corner. “Can you try it too?” asked the prince. </p>
        <p>“She can’t try it on, she works in the kitchen,” replied Cinderellas cunning stepmother. The kind prince lifted Cinderella’s foot onto the cushion. The slipper fitted! No one could believe it.</p>
        <p>“I’ve found you!” said the kind prince. He took Cinderella’s hand in his, and asked her to marry him. </p>
        <p>Her stepsisters could only stand by and watch as the prince and Cinderella became husband and wife. </p>
