        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <p>Cinderella gave a frightened cry – she hadn’t noticed the time! She gave a quick apology to the prince and ran off. As she ran down the flight of steps she left behind on of her glass slippers. </p>
        <p>Cinderella jumped into the carriage, but the magic wore off just as she started the journey home. The carriage turned back into a giant pumpkin, the horses became mice again and her gown and jewels vanished.</p>
        <p>The handsome prince’s heart was very heavy. He had fallen in love with Cinderella, and wanted to visit every house in his country with her glass slipper. “I will hunt high and low,” said the prince. “Whoever this slipper fits shall be my bride.” He hunted all night and all day, just as he said and visited all the homes in his kingdom. Soon he arrived at the house where Cinderella lived with her stepmother and stepsisters. </p>
