        <h1>Alternate Chapter 3</h1>
        <p>Cinderella gave a frightened cry – she hadn’t noticed the time! She gave a quick apology to the prince and ran off. As she ran down the flight of steps she left behind on of her glass slippers. </p>
        <p>The handsome prince’s heart was very heavy. He had fallen in love with Cinderella, and wanted to visit every house in his country with her glass slipper. “I will hunt high and low,” said the prince. “Whoever this slipper fits shall be my bride.” Soon he arrived at the house where Cinderella lived with her stepmother and stepsisters. </p>
        <p>Of course, the stepsisters feet couldn’t fit. “Can I try it too?” asked Cinderella. </p>
        <p>The prince nodded and Cinderella slipped it onto her foot—and it fit perfectly.</p>
        <p>"This cannot be! You cannot marry a commoner!" A man said behind him and glared at Cinderella.</p>
        <p>"You must pick someone else, your highness…she'll never do to be a Queen."</p>
        <p>The Prince did not defend Cinderella. He looked back at the man and nodded.</p>
        <p>"Your father would never agree to the marriage. Just take one of her sisters."</p>
        <p>Cinderella watched as he looked sadly at me and nodded.</p>
        <p>"But last night!" Cinderella started and stood up. "Last night you told me you loved me; you told me that I would make a wonderful Queen… you told me that you wanted to marry me."</p>
        <p>"That was before he knew what you really were, you little commoner!" The man behind the Prince blurted out. She looked at the Prince and began to cry.</p>
        <p>"I'm sorry, Cinderella…" He whispered and looked at her with such regret. It was almost as if they both knew what a horrible life they were going to experience…</p>
        <p>And those last hours at the ball would haunt them for the rest of their lives.</p>
        <p>She knew at that moment, She would never again see her dearest Prince.</p>
        <p>He extended a hand toward Cinderella's oldest Stepsister and she grabbed it hastily.</p>
        <p>Cinderella would never again believe in happy endings; fairy godmothers or love.</p>
        <p>She threw the slipper against the wall and watched as it broke into a million pieces and all her dreams and wishes shattered with it.</p>
