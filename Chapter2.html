        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <p>A big, ripe pumpkin from the vegetable patch grew so big it looked as if it was ready to pop!The enormous pumpkin transformed into a beautiful carriage, while four mice became stunning white horses! As the magic swirled around, a brown rat turned into a coachman and Cinderella clapped her hands.With a clap of her hands, Cinderella’s clever fairy godmother turned Cinderella’s plain clothes into a glamorous gown, Cinderella’s hair became glossy, and on her feet, were glittery glass slippers.</p>
        <p>Cinderella glowed with happiness. “Wow, this is all so magical. What a lovely dress and just look at these fabulous slippers!” said Cinderella. “Keep a close eye on the clock,” warned the fairy godmother. “The spell will end when the clock strikes twelve and all of this will disappear.”</p>
        <p>Cinderella arrived at the palace in her beautiful carriage. She walked into the palace and was immediately spotted by the prince himself. The price just knew that he had to dance with this mysterious girl who had turned up in a fascinating carriage and the most unique of dresses. The prince asked Cinderella to dance, and she was delighted. While the dancing carried on into the night, the clock struck twelve.</p>
