        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <p>A big, ripe pumpkin from the vegetable patch grew so big it looked as if it was ready to pop!</p>
        <p>The enormous pumpkin transformed into a beautiful carriage, while four mice became stunning white horses! As the magic swirled around, a brown rat turned into a coachman and Cinderella clapped her hands.</p>
        <p>With a clap of her hands, Cinderella’s clever fairy godmother turned Cinderella’s plain clothes into a glamorous gown, Cinderella’s hair became glossy, and on her feet, were glittery glass slippers.</p>
